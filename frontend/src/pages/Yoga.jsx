      "We all struggle to lead peaceful content lives. As the ancient saying goes, as long as our mind is in pieces and the pieces are in ceaseless, mutual conflict, peace eludes us. As soon as one looks at the mind as a whole by placing these pieces together (integration) then only can one get Peace of Kaivalya or Liberation which is the ultimate goal of Life. We can experience real Joy in the Heart (Atmaananda) when we look at ourselves by way of Integration of your five senses which gives Insight for the Self, which is easy to achieve and implement in our day-to-day life. Patanjali was one of the eminent ancient Sages who identified these pieces of the mind, which most, many archive instead of peace. He termed those as Vruttis, which are never-subsiding and are always arising. Vruttis need to be controlled, suppressed, eliminated by the right kind of training and discipline which can be achieved through Dispassion (Vairagya) and Sadhana, this can easily be obtained. Dispassion is born out of two ways: when you suffer in life and when you attain certain knowledge of Life (Jnana). Yoga is a word derived from the Sanskrit word Yuj (to yoke, to get Samadhi or perfect concentration) — Union of Individual self with Higher Self!",

    description:
      "NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE is a distinct system of healing, a philosophy, science, art, and practice which seeks to promote health by stimulating and supporting the body's inherent power to regain harmony and balance. This therapeutic system dates to the Era 400 BC when Hippocrates became famous for his treatment of diseases in accordance with Natural Laws. In practice, the naturopathic principles are applied mainly in two ways: by educating people to be aware and responsible for their own health and to access them to understand the Fundamental Laws of Health – relating to rest, exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle; by using various natural therapies to increase the vitality of the individual and to remove any obstructions – chemical, physical, psychological – which may be interfering with the normal functioning and internal harmony of the organs and the tissues. Thus any modality which is non-toxic, non-suppressive of symptoms, and supportive of the self-healing process is applicable in Naturopathic Practice. The choice of treatment is determined not only by any dogmatic principles but also by the needs and capabilities of the people. The principle of this system is to emphasize the importance of nutrition, exercise, rest, therapeutic use of light, air, water, and restoration of the structural integrity and psychological counseling and individual clinical judgment. It looks toward a sufferer as a person with a holistic and individualistic view. It tries to focus on and eradicate the root cause of the disease. No therapeutic system is complete in itself. It is best to assimilate and utilize the positive aspects of different therapies. To carry out investigations and to make the diagnosis by the most modern methods and then to follow it up with appropriate treatment by either naturopathy, yoga, homeopathy, etc. seems to be the ideal combination for tackling health problems both at physical and mental levels. The age-old maxim that Health is Wealth is universal in its applicability. It is the prime responsibility of each individual to maintain and nurture it. In order to maintain good health throughout, people have to reduce their dependence on medicines, do regular exercise, develop good eating habits, and adopt diets which are balanced (satwik aahara). To achieve an ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body, one must exercise control over one’s mind – its thought processes and emotions – make it a habit so that it becomes Second Nature. It is through a healthy body and mind that man can aspire to rise and evolve to the higher states of consciousness – the intended purpose of the creator. Naturopathy shows the way. God has not given us any disease for which he has not provided a remedy, only we must have the vision to look at it.",

      "If we were to open hair salons in every square mile of every town and city across the world, making haircuts affordable and accessible to all, this would never stop the process of hair growth. Similarly, however swift and advanced medical science and modern technology become, we cannot halt the progression of prevalent and upcoming diseases, the likes of which make it near impossible for any human being to lead a healthy, peaceful existence. With so much money funneled into studies and research, better technology, and the development of new medicines, we are no closer to eradicating diseases now than we were centuries before. The fact is though that the number and variations of these diseases is increasing at an alarming rate and considerable amounts are Iatrogenic diseases (due to human error). Whatever medicines are available today become worthless tomorrow. As the saying goes, today’s sense becomes tomorrow’s nonsense. Irrespective of the growing number of physicians, hospitals, and healthcare providers, more and more people fall sick every year. We are clearly seeing the trappings of our own makings. With the aim of getting a victory over Nature, human beings are committing grave and unforgivable mistakes. We have a large populous of uneducated and illiterate people, millions lack the basic necessities of food, shelter, and good drinking water. We have poor hygiene, unprecedented levels of pollution in the air we breathe, and false beliefs, not to mention all that we are willing to sacrifice environmentally for the sake of money and power. It is not surprising to be witnessing such an upsurge of new and old diseases. We are living more complicated lives and less natural ones at that. We are also relinquishing our previous understandings, which so many generations and cultures before us have known inherently: that we are part of Nature, and whatsoever ails us can be cured by Her gifts alone. For example, wherever there is an area with poisonous snakes, it is known that anti-venom will be found in the same location. Or, if you are climbing a mountain and come across injury, you can be sure that a cure is growing in the nearby vegetation (e.g., Arnica – Montana). As far as looking or hunting for an effective and easy-to-apply medical system based on the laws of Nature, Homeopathy ranks first. Homeopathy is a Holistic, Scientific, and Time-tested System of Medicine. It was invented by the German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in the 17th century. He was born on the 10th of April, 1755, in Meissein, Germany. His father was a painter. He came from a poor economical background, and had to struggle a lot in his younger days but he was quite motivated and finished his MD from Erlangen University. He became an Allopathic physician, yet was soon disillusioned by the limitations of Modern Medicine and the practices that were common at the time, like bloodletting. After finishing his post-graduation, his thirst for knowledge could not be quenched. He studied a vast number of subjects and served in various positions. He was often the brunt of criticism from his peers and often had very little to eat or to support his family with but he was never swayed from his main goal.",

      "Ayur means life and Veda means knowledge. Any knowledge which is systematic and based on facts is known as SCIENCE. This is why Ayurveda is understood as the science of life. Its origin is traced back to the vedic times about 5000 B.C. During this period medicine was dominated by mythology and sages. Dhanvantari — the God of medicine was born out of the churning of the ocean during a war between Gods and demons. It is also believed that ayurveda was developed from the medical part of the vedas — the Atharvaveda. Ayurveda is not just a system of medicine. It is a way of life. It has been practiced for thousands of years and has clearly stood the test of time. It is still regularly practiced today in India and its counterpart has credibility to Allopathy and Homeopathy. The overall maintenance of health, prevention of disease, treatment of disease at its root and rehabilitation of the patient is the basis of Ayurveda. Pulse diagnosis is one of the key methods of diagnosing diseases in Ayurveda. The tradition of learning this art of medicine is still passed down through Oral transmission and apprenticeship. Gurukula means living with the master and learning and sharing the experiences of this guru. This helps the disciple (shishya) to conceptualize and absorb the basic framework which is the backbone of practical Ayurveda. Sushruta was the first physician of Ayurveda who developed and practised surgery. Known as the father of surgery, it is reported that he used ants to stitch together a wound. Some of the other eminent Ayurvedic physicians include — Atreya, Charaka, Waghbhatt who practised about 800 B.C. The majority of Ayurvedic texts are in Sanskrit. These texts give great importance and reference to a person’s constitution, food as medicine, the importance of herbs, the art of identifying and collecting herbs, including how and when to pick them (the time, season, etc.), as well how and where to store them.",

      "Stress is becoming a key word in our day to day life. A certain amount of stress is necessary and even a beneficial element for our lives. To simplify it we can say stress has two faces – positive stress and negative stress. Among the above, positive stress can do wonders in life only if it is dealt with properly and rationally. For example, while crossing the road if you see a vehicle roaring towards you, you surely know that is not the moment to be cool, calm, and relaxed. That is the moment to run away as early as you can. Conversely, an example of negative stress can be you fight with your friend or spouse and will result in suffering from a headache. Physical symptoms of stress: breathlessness, palpitations, nausea or vomiting feeling, dizziness, asthma, urge for smoking, loss of appetite, craving for food, insomnia or lack of sleep, nightmares, constant tiredness, onset of allergies, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, ulcer, tapping finger or foot, headache or migraine, anxiety attack, neck pain, eczema, prone to accidents and shaking hands, prone to various accidents, impotence, high blood pressure, anger, violent mood, phobia, heart attack, stroke and many more as per the severity of the stress.

      "Pranayam, often referred to as the 'art of breath control,' is a vital component of yoga that focuses on the regulation and extension of breath. Originating from the ancient Indian traditions, the word 'Pranayam' is derived from two Sanskrit words: 'Prana,' meaning life force or vital energy, and 'Ayama,' meaning control or extension. Together, they signify the practice of harnessing and channeling the vital life force within the body through controlled breathing techniques. The practice of Pranayam is based on the understanding that breath is the bridge between the body and the mind. By mastering the breath, one can achieve greater control over the mind and emotions, leading to enhanced physical health, mental clarity, and spiritual growth. Pranayam consists of various breathing techniques, each designed to achieve specific benefits, such as calming the mind, increasing energy levels, detoxifying the body, and balancing the nervous system. One of the most fundamental techniques in Pranayam is 'Nadi Shodhana' or alternate nostril breathing. This practice involves inhaling through one nostril while closing the other with a finger, then exhaling through the opposite nostril, and repeating the process in reverse. Nadi Shodhana is believed to purify the energy channels (nadis) in the body, promote mental clarity, and reduce stress and anxiety. Another popular Pranayam technique is 'Kapalabhati,' often referred to as the 'skull-shining breath.' This technique involves forceful exhalations followed by passive inhalations, creating a rhythmic and energizing breathing pattern. Kapalabhati is known to stimulate the digestive system, improve lung capacity, and invigorate the mind and body. 'Bhastrika,' or bellows breath, is a dynamic Pranayam technique that involves rapid, forceful inhalations and exhalations, mimicking the action of a blacksmith's bellows. This practice increases oxygen intake, boosts energy levels, and purifies the respiratory system. 'Bhramari,' or the bee breath, is a calming Pranayam technique that involves making a humming sound during exhalation, resembling the buzzing of a bee. This practice is highly effective in reducing stress, soothing the nervous system, and promoting a deep sense of relaxation and inner peace. Regular practice of Pranayam offers numerous benefits, including improved respiratory function, enhanced concentration, reduced stress and anxiety, and increased overall vitality. It also helps in balancing the body's energy centers (chakras) and promoting spiritual growth. In conclusion, Pranayam is a powerful and transformative practice that extends beyond mere breath control. It is a holistic approach to achieving harmony between the body, mind, and spirit, fostering overall well-being and inner peace.",
